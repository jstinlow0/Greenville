# Greenville

Greenville is a program that originally started as a program that printed the title of the program out onto the screen. 
Eventually, as time progressed, I with other fellow peers worked on the code to imporved it by adding classes and objects that would act as a ticket counter and more.
Created a ticket counter, ticket calculator, contestants, adding and seeing who is participating in the Greenville concert. 
This is an incomplete class project but it is what We have came up with so far.
